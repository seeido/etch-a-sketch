# Etch a Sketch
A simple etch a sketch app made with the challenge of using only flexbox!

The sketch is a div containing img tags that get colored when you hover over them while holding LMB (div tags are laggy so I used img tags instead).

Note: the website is currently fully functional only on webkit-based browsers (chrome, safari, etc.), support for mobile and moz-based browsers might be added later.
