# Etch a Sketch
### This project is a part of The Odin Project curriculum
#### The layout of the sketch is made using only FLEXBOX as a challenge, the sketch is a div containing img tags that get colored when you hover over them while holding LMB (div tags are laggy so I used img tags instead).
Note: the website is currently fully functional only on webkit-based browsers (chrome, safari, etc.), I might make it functional on mobile and moz-based browsers later but it's not an improtant project so it's better to focus on other stuff right now.
